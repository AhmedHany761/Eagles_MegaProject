<br>Features:
*	Power Efficiency: The Jetson Nano is designed to provide high computing power while being energy-efficient. This is crucial for UAV applications, as power constraints are common due to limited battery capacity. 
*	GPU Acceleration: The Jetson Nano comes with a powerful integrated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) based on NVIDIA's CUDA architecture. This GPU acceleration enables efficient parallel processing of tasks such as computer vision, image processing, and artificial intelligence algorithms. 
*	Compact Size and Weight: The Jetson Nano is compact and lightweight, making it suitable for integration into small UAV platforms with limited payload capacity.
*	 Supports popular software frameworks and libraries used in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This includes TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and others, making it easier to develop and deploy advanced AI algorithms on the UAV.

Possible Connections between the Pixhawk and the jetson nano:  

1-UART Connection:
The Jetson Nano can be connected to the Cube Orange+ Pixhawk using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication. The UART connection utilizes the serial ports available on both devices for data exchange.
This is the connection I found most suitable for the UAV.
Reasons for Choosing the UART Connection:
*	Lightweight Connection: UART connection requires fewer resources and is suitable for applications where space and weight considerations are critical, such as small UAVs.
*	Low Latency: UART communication offers low latency, making it suitable for time-critical applications that require fast data transfer.
*	Compatibility: Both the Jetson Nano and Pixhawk typically have UART ports available, allowing for direct hardware-level communication.

2-USB Connection:
The Jetson Nano can be connected to the Cube Orange+ Pixhawk using a USB cable. The USB connection provides a simple and direct link between the two devices. The Jetson Nano can be powered via USB and can communicate with the Pixhawk for data exchange.
The USB connection is easy to set up and requires minimal additional hardware and offers reliable and high-speed data transfer between the Jetson Nano and Pixhawk.  

3-Telemetry Connection:
Using a telemetry module or radio, the Jetson Nano can establish a wireless connection with the Pixhawk, allowing bidirectional data transmission between the two devices, but we wonâ€™t need this connection as the jetson nano is our on-board computer and its close to the Pixhawk.

## Ubiquiti BULLET AC:
Ubiquiti Bullet AC is a wireless radio with an integrated Type N RF connector . It works great on any distance, is weatherproof and allows real TCP/IP throughput of up to 300Mbps.  
A Wireless transmission link will be constructed between The Ground Control Station and the Ubiquiti Bullet Ac with a 5GHz of frequency.
